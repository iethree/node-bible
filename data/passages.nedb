He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban's flock. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01030041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01030042-1\">42&nbsp;</b>but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there.

He was a chief tax collector and was rich. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42019003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42019004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42019005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, <span class=\"woc\">“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42019006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42019007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And when they saw it, they all grumbled, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42019008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor.

They gathered, some more, some less. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02016018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack.

He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43008045-1\">45&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43008046-1\">46&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Which one of you convicts me of sin?

Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45014023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith.

For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</p>\n<p id=\"p45007020_09-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.esv.org\" class=\"copyright\">ESV</a>)</p></div>","next":"45008001-45008039","prev":"45006001-45006023","queries":["Romans 7","Romans 7"],"views":1,"_id":"lV1hPoi5lc8eo9Cg"}

And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014055-1\">55&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014056-1\">56&nbsp;</b>For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014057-1\">57&nbsp;</b>And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014058-1\">58&nbsp;</b>“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014059-1\">59&nbsp;</b>Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014060-1\">60&nbsp;</b>And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014061-1\">61&nbsp;</b>But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014062-1\">62&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said, <span class=\"woc\">“I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014063-1\">63&nbsp;</b>And the high priest tore his garments and said, “What further witnesses do we need? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014064-1\">64&nbsp;</b>You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?” And they all condemned him as deserving death. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014065-1\">65&nbsp;</b>And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards received him with blows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"p41014065_45-1\">Peter Denies Jesus</h3>\n<p id=\"p41014065_48-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014066-1\">66&nbsp;</b>And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014067-1\">67&nbsp;</b>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014068-1\">68&nbsp;</b>But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean.” And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014069-1\">69&nbsp;</b>And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014070-1\">70&nbsp;</b>But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, “Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014071-1\">71&nbsp;</b>But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41014072-1\">72&nbsp;</b>And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, <span class=\"woc\">“Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”</span> And he broke down and wept.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.esv.org\" class=\"copyright\">ESV</a>)</p></div>","next":"41015001-41015047","prev":"41013001-41013037","queries":["Mark 14","Mark 14"],"views":1,"_id":"nlepTdQWJkelznbG"}
